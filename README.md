# MK-COMMS Network
The MK-COMMS network is an IRC-based data interfacing system designed to allow certain programs access other services without manually programming in said services. To do this, a service can send commands, such as 'send root-micro1337 Hello!', which sends the message 'Hello!' to the service root-micro1337. What the service does with the data is completely up to the service's use. For example, if the service is a Discord Bot, it could post the message to a Discord server, or if the service is a logging service, it could simply remember the message. Services can use the command 'ping' to probe for active services. When an active service discovers a 'ping' command, they should reply with 'pong'. pong commands broadcast the service's presence to all other services, in case any require that particular service.
