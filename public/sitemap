Hello! This is no ordinary static file sharing service. You can also send files to me!

Use 'rqst rpi-service file <filename> <b64 file>' to upload a file.
If no errors arise, I will give you an ack response.

You can retrieve files with 'rqst rpi-service get <filename>'.

To list all files, use 'rqst rpi-service get list'.


Thanks for using this dynamic file service!
